<br /><br />EDIT [0143 24-10-2013]:<br />
- The calculation of time has been misbehaving, maybe because of different timezone of the server and the assumed IST timezone for calculations. But, anyway, that is not gonna make any effect as it is same for all,<br />

<h2>Now, enjoy!!!</h2>

<br /><br />EDIT [0217 24-10-2013]:<br />
- The process of fixing the time calculation code is going on. The server timezone was set to America/New_York, and hence caused problems. :-(

<br /><br />EDIT [0224 24-10-2013]:<br />
- The time-points calculation code is now working fine. All the users that were affected are now corrected. :D 

<br /><br />EDIT [2150 24-10-2013]:<br />
- The last question <strike>C</strike>WTF? shall be uploaded by 2300hours.
