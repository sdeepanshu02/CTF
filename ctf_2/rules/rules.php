<p>Welcome to Online treasure hunt: Capture the flag.</p>

<p>
The objective of your adventurous scavenger hunt will be to locate "flags" for every question, and post it.<br>
A correct flag will earn you the corresponding points of the question; there are no partial marks, because that would be a pain to implement in code.
</p>
<p>
Flags are phrases or words which act as passwords that are to be submitted through a form present below each question page.
</p>
<p>
Questions 1 to 3 are of 50 points each.<br>
Questions 4 to 7 are of 100 points each.<br>
Questions 8 and 9 are of 200 points each.<br>
Any other questions will be of 200 points.
</p>
<p>
The time taken till your last successful submission will be a criteria for tie-breaking if the points match with another contestant.
</p>
<p>
Look out for current score updates on facebook.
